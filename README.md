## INTRO

This API was made to demonstrate the technical knowledge in programming during the selection process of the company Tecnofit. Good programming practices were followed to the fullest.

Challenge: Considering the database below, build a REST endpoint (preferably in PHP)
that returns the ranking of a given movement, bringing the movement name and a
ordered list with users, their respective personal record (highest value), position and date. Attention: Users with the same personal best value must occupy the same position
in the ranking.

As a bonus, authentication was added using Passport and a route with general ranking of users (sum of all scores in all exercises/movements).

## ABOUT

The API is composed of 3 entities: User, Movement and Personal Record.

**User**
They are the users of the application, athletes.

**Movement**
Are the exercises practiced by users.

**Personal Record**
It is the record of user records in each movement practiced.
